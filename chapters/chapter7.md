# Chapter Seven: Saving Jartsa

Our intrepid band of heroes found themselves amidst the lively and smoky atmosphere of Newshire’s Old Metro bar. Thule, feeling the wear of past adventures, treated himself to some new clothes for his waist, trying to blend into the rough-and-tumble tavern crowd. The party ordered beers, the frothy mugs clinking as they shared laughter and stories, but their attention was soon drawn to a hardened old warrior seated in a darkened corner of the bar.

His hands were full of scars, each mark a whispered tale of past battles. A well-worn sword rested against his chair, and his tired eyes spoke of a man who had seen too much. As he drank, he began sharing tales of the city’s tumultuous history, a saga of survival and war. He warned the party of the Foglands, a toxic wasteland only accessible to those with protective spells or gas masks. “Only fools venture there unprepared,” he muttered, a grave look crossing his face.

The warrior mentioned the people of Metrol, recalling the comrades he had fought beside. “One was a mayor,” he said, “who boasted he had nine lives. He vanished before the war's end. Me? I’m done with fighting.” As the conversation drifted into solemn silence, the bar’s doors creaked open, and in walked two imposing Warforged, accompanied by a metallic bear. The room seemed to hold its breath.

Elsewhere, the rest of the party rummaged through sacks of loot they had recently acquired. Their search revealed a diamond, jewels, and magical trinkets hidden in pouches imbued with enchantments. Yet, their horse was still missing, a mystery they had to solve soon.

Their journey led them to the city’s guarded gates, where they debated how best to gain entry. Two mounted guards watched them warily, and the party decided to request an audience with the head of the city’s guards. Meanwhile, back at the bar, the two Warforged spoke with a familiar face, Savo. They inquired about their boss, but the old warrior shrugged, offering little but cryptic remarks. “They come and go,” he said, gesturing dismissively.

Thule and Fonzie eventually noticed Sylvanus, who had been surveying the area for signs of trouble. The party debated whether to speak with the guards directly, noting the many horses stabled nearby. The party’s druid, ever curious, wondered if he could communicate with the horses, but they decided instead to proceed with their meeting.
In the guardhouse, the head of security spoke grimly about the dangers approaching the city. “Haven’t been to the mist yet, have you?” he said, as if testing them. The party mentioned they had slain a witch, but the boss dismissed it as mere legend. As they left, he called out one final warning. “Stay away from the mist!”

Intrigued by their magical loot, the group tested one of the enchanted pouches. It allowed them to put things inside but not to retrieve them easily. They tested it with a log, which vanished, making the pouch feel heavier by 800 grams.
Stepping out of the inn, they were approached by a man from House Natalix, who announced that their horse and carriage had gone missing. “I’d like them back,” he demanded, naming a steep price of 150 gold. Reluctantly, the party pooled their money, each contributing 25 gold to resolve the issue.

The missing horses remained a mystery, but there were more pressing matters at hand. They sought out Jartsa, a smith rumored to craft gas masks for surviving the poisonous Foglands. As they approached Jartsa’s hut, a sense of dread washed over them. A hacking cough echoed in the air, though Fonzie, their Warlock, remained unaffected. From inside the smith’s workshop, a sinister presence lurked.

It was Jartsa himself, flanked by a wraith and undead minions, a malevolent aura surrounding them. The party drew their weapons, ready to face whatever horrors lay ahead.   The party burst into Jartsa’s hut, where a swarm of monsters awaited. At the forefront was a fearsome wraith, its icy gaze sending chills through their bones. Undead creature accompanied it, snarling and clawing to protect their dark master. In the corner, Jartsa, the smith they had come to save, cowered in terror.

Fonzie unleashed blast of magic at their foes. Sylvanus engaged them with bow, but the wraith struck back fiercely, nearly draining the life from nearby standers. The battle seemed hopeless until the wraith dissolved into nothingness. The party stood victorious, bloodied but alive. Jartsa was barely alive. They had narrowly escaped doom, but their quest was far from over—the Foglands still awaited
